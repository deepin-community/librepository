A list of changes in recent versions:

0.2.0: (30-May-2008)
       * Code-hardening: Explict checks for Null-Values added.
  
       * Switched from JCommon to LibBase. All version information is now contained in
         the manifest. The Project-Info implementation reads the version numbers from
         the Jar's Manifest or the compiler-output-directory.

       * Completed the ZIP repositories. The library now provides three flavors:
         - read-only streaming repository
         - write-only streaming repository
         - read-write memory-buffered repository

       * [BUG] Generating ZIP repositories was generally unstable. The repository did
         not write un-compressed entries as it required a precomputed CRC32 checksum.
         
0.1.6: (30-Nov-2007)
       * Updated the error messages for the file-repository.
         We now explicitly check whether the directories for
         the content-locations exist. If they do not exist,
         the implementation throws exceptions ..

0.1.5: (02-Nov-2007)
        * Upgraded to jcommon-1.0.12

0.1.4: (16-Oct-2007)
        * Automatic fixes as reported by IntelliJ-IDEA's inspections
    
        * Updated the copyright header on all java-files

0.1.3: (24-Sep-2007)
        * All releases are now built with JDK 1.4. However, we are still compatible
          with JDK 1.2.2 and all releases run and compile under that release.

0.1.2: (30-Jun-2007)
        * [BUG] The ZIP-Repository was not closed correctly, causing unreadable files.
    
        * The default-name-generator tries to extract a suitable default-suffix from
          the given default-filename.

0.1.1: (27-May-2007)
        * Added a mime-type mapping for CSS-files. Mime-Mapping should be configurable.
    
0.1.0: (03-Dec-2006)
        * Initial version.
